#Spaces in file name
#To use a filename with spaces in it, you can wrap it in quotes like this:
cat "file name with spaces"
#You may also escape every space with backslash but it is more work and more confusing than the previous method:
cat file\ name\ with\ spaces
#Basically, you put a \ before every space in the filename.
