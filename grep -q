#In Linux, the grep -q command is used to search for a pattern in text files, but it operates in a quiet or silent mode. Here's what it does:

#-q stands for "quiet" or "silent" mode.
#When you use grep with the -q option, it doesn't produce any output to the terminal.
#Instead of printing matching lines to the terminal, it simply exits with one of two exit codes:
#Exit code 0: This means that a match was found.
#Exit code 1: This means that no match was found.
#This is useful when you want to check if a pattern exists in a file within a script or a command chain without displaying the matched lines. For example, you might use it in a conditional statement within a shell script to perform different actions based on whether a pattern is found or not.
#Here's an example of how you might use grep -q in a shell script:

if grep -q "pattern" file.txt; then
    echo "Pattern found in file."
else
    echo "Pattern not found in file."
fi
